# Content Publisher

This is a obsidian plugin for export markdown to other markdown.

Currently can handle below during exporting.

1. YAML format which to form metadata.
2. Wikilinks handling, convert to other format base on setting. (mostly Markdonwlinks)

# Usage

Suppose that I have a blog base on [Astro](https://astro.build/), so I got local project like `/User/me/projects/astro-paper`. Markdown content in Obsidian has a little bit different in blog project. Therefore, I got this plugin to handle it, in order to keep my original notes in obsidian with obsidian way, and publish it to blog project with it's own way. (normally restrain by Markdown and project content schema)
